# Base helpers

## Arguments helper

Helps to extract the arguments used when creating a Pipe.

## Builders

Need refactor, rework and renaming! WTF!?

## Family notify helper

Used to notify family pipes of value change up and down the family tree.

## List value extractor

Meant to be a Helper base class with general functionality to validate and extract list values to be used for setting
the ArrayValueObject. Both ListAttributePipe and CollectionPipe use such values, but ListAttributePipe expects and
validates primitive only while CollectionPipe expects and validates Objects only.
